# all-the-free-drum-kits

scrapes [freedrumkits](http://www.freedrumkits.net/). i mostly wanted to play with [trumpet](https://github.com/substack/node-trumpet)

i haven't actually ran this to completion, because there are like 276 kits on there

### use it

```
$ npm install
$ node cli --path /here/are/my/kits --start 30
```

`path` defaults to the current directory, and `start` defaults to `0`. it's worth looking at how [their URLs](http://www.freedrumkits.net/drum-kits?start=20) look, since it'll `start` wherever you specify

:star2: make beats to your heart's content :star2:
